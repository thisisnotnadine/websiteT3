    <div class="text-content">
        <p>The economic, social and demographic evidence all points toward a history of women more dynamic and diverse than we might have expected from the "stereotype." Women were on the move to frontiers and to cities or, if they stayed at home, they were often heads of households. Besides being subsistence farmers, weavers and churchgoers, they were market vendors, nuns, tobacco leaf sorters, domestic helpers, schoolteachers, cigar-makers, washerwomen and commercial sex workers. They married younger, if they married at all; many were single mothers, at least in the eyes of the church. They owned property, sued their debtors, and even went on strike. And when the revolution came, some supported it or participated in it.</p>
    
        <p>Yet so far as we know, none of this was inspired by, or reflected in, any major shift in gender ideology. Centuries before, Spain had introduced a set of patriarchal values, which erupted at times into outright misogyny:</p>
    
        <blockquote>Woman is the most monstrous animal in the whole of Nature, bad-tempered and worse spoken. To have this animal in the house is asking for trouble .... Casimiro Dias, OSA, 1745</blockquote>
    
        <p>Filipinos had, by and large, adopted and adapted these patriarchal values; the most that can be said (or at least documented) is that they softened them slightly, emphasizing those aspects of Christianity that stress complementarity, or even equality, between the sexes. A Filipino pasyon (popular religious verse) of the early 19th century uses the exemplary marriage of Mary and Joseph to illustrate a lesson (aral):</p>
        <blockquote>Thus, under one roof, they did live, / the two friends, without pause, night and day, / praised ceaselessly / the Lord God most wise.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Carpenter was the profession / of this holy man / while the work of the woman / was to sew and weave / and to take care of the household.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Thus, the wills of the two / were united as one/ peaceful was their existence  / blessed most lavishly / by God the Lord Father. </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Lesson</blockquote>
        <blockquote> Christians, it is right/ that we should imitate their good conduct I and gentle spirit / as they lived together. </blockquote>
        <blockquote> Every married couple / should always imitate them. / If their companionship  is well / mercy and precious grace / will not abandon them. </blockquote>
        <blockquote> But those who quarrel much / those who bicker night and day / those full of anger / will be abandoned / by the grace most precious. </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Therefore, couples whoever they may be / must heed one another. / Imitate Joseph / and Mary, the comely one, / in their care for their home.             </blockquote>
        <p>But as Priscelina Patajo-Legasto points out, this remains a "patriarchal text," and she attacks its "phallogocentrism," which produces "ambivalent, even contradictory, representations of women." Eve, she notes, is depicted as "derivative" from Adam. "Power-hungry, vainglorious and feeble-minded," Eve is blamed for the Fall, and so deserves her punishment of "suffering beyond compare." Biological reproduction itself is part of God's "curse" on her, and is contrasted with Mary's later chastity, to the point that Mary even baulked at Joseph as a husband until God promised her that her "purity should suffer no stain." But whether as the source of evil or as consecrated to the good, woman remains "man's Other, the representation of alterity."
        </p>
    <p>The problem, of course, is that this text was (presumably) written by a male, as are virtually all other representations of Filipino thought in the Spanish period. Women did not publish;their letters, by and large, have not survived. What we are left with, for now, is texts produced by (Filipino) men that reflect on gender relations. Of these, two stand out in the attention they received, both at the time and in subsequent study: Urbana at Felisa, a popular Tagalog book of manners written by a secular priest, Modesto de Castro, in the 1860s, and Jose Rizal's famous novel, Noli Me Tangere (with its sequel, El Filibusterismo).  It is beyond the scope of this paper-and beyond my competence-to provide an exhaustive analysis of these texts, but some comment on how they have been interpreted may be in order.
    </p>
    <p>For a start, they, like the pasyon, were not only produced by men and censored by priests (with the Casaysayan ultimately passing the censor, and Noli briefly passed before being prohibited), but they are, almost by definition, the product of the Filipino elite. Despite this, they differed considerably in the class audience for which they were apparently intended. The pasyon, as noted, was for the masses, a text for Everyman (and Everywoman). Memorized even by those who could not read, its annual recitation was a major civic-religious ritual in many of the Tagalog provinces. Urbana at Felisa, on the other hand, was an etiquette manual clearly aimed at the aspiring bourgeoisie, people who had enough money to buy napkins, but were not quite sure how to use them. It demanded literacy, and among its literate audience it sold well, becoming in effect the "Emily Post" for a whole generation of ilustrados. Rizal, finally, was operating at an even higher level. He wrote not just in Spanish (the other works were in Tagalog), but in convoluted literary language, and he tended to satirize those Filipinos whose Spanish was not up to the mark or who had more pretensions that taste-the readers of Urbana at Felisa, perhaps? So, although these texts jointly offer a (male) Filipino image of what gender was and should be in the 19th century, there are differences in how they approach this question.
    </p>
    <p>Eviota sees Urbana at Felisa as essentially restricting the sexual behavior ofFilipinas, along Hispanic/Western lines:
    </p>
        <blockquote>Daughters should be taught to fear God, to take care of their virginity and to be modest ... Women should be taught to keep house and to love the home ... Married women were to devote their lives to family and home. A married woman is subservient to the man who is the head of the household. She sh6uld serve her husband and look after his needs; she should be self sacrificing and bear with her husband's faults. </blockquote>
    <p> Mina Races, while not denying any of this, claims that the fact that this book was written for and about women is a sign that women were seen not just as "cultural transmitters" but as "agents of change" and "moral guardians." Urbana at Felisa was not just a restatement of traditional customs, she suggests, but an attempt to prescribe new rules for the newly Hispanized and urbanized Filipino elite. Castro, in effect, acknowledged women as "the means through which modern values were introduced into society." Among the values promoted were "duties to one's town/country" (katungkulan sa bayan), which Roces implies is a kind of precursor to both Philippine nationalism and "education for citizenship." </p>  
    <p> Did Rizal-hero, martyr and greatest writer of the Propaganda Movement-move beyond this? The question has been at the center of debates within Philippine feminism since at least 1963, when Carmen Guerrero Nakpil described Maria Clara, heroine ofRizal's novels, as the "greatest misfortune that has befallen the Filipina in the last one hundred years." Maria Clara, beloved of the protagonist, Crisostomo Ibarra, is beautiful and fragile, humorless and prone to fainting, a perennial victim and a bumbler. She is bullied by her parents and abused by the friars ( one of whom turns out to be her real father); she betrays her lover and winds up in a nunnery, only to be further abused there. As Nakpil put it, "she made a talent for unhappiness her greatest virtue."    </p>   
    <p>Most feminists today are inclined to exonerate Rizal, at least partially, for the feminine (but certainly not feminist) icon Maria Clara became. Lilia Quindoza Santiago points to the wide range of more diverse female characters created by Rizal, some of whom are braver than Maria Clara, and have a better sense of humor.68 Violeta Lopez-Gonzaga suggests that Rizal transcended the model of Urbana at Felisa, thanks to his mother, Dofia Teodora Alonzo, who provided an "alternative role model." Noli, she claims, represents women as they are, not as they should be. "Though commonly thought to be Rizal's ideal role model for women, Maria Clara actually provides a subtle critique of the predominant mold of women in his time. “ </p>
    <p>Readers of Rizal's novels-available in several English translations-will have to decide for themselves whether the portrait of Maria Clara is indeed a satirical social comment or whether the otherwise-perceptive author simply had a blind spot for a certain type of woman (which is my own reading). We can, however, discern other themes in Rizal's writings on women, particularly as mothers and wives.</p>
    <p> Rizal's strong admiration of, and identification with, his own mother is well known, and the equation of love of mother with love of country is frequently found in his work (e.g. in the "Song of Maria Clara" in Noli). Perhaps the most perceptive analysis of this is by Vicente L. Rafael, who explores metaphors of dreaming, memory, translation and mourning in Rizal's imagining of the "motherland. " The novels are full of mothers, from the tragic peasant Sisa, whose unbearable exploitation eventually drives her insane, to the stoic Capitana Maria, who was able to watch silently as her sons were beaten for a patriotic cause. There are good mothers and bad mothers, but the very worst women, Rizal implies, are those who are never mothers at all. </p>
    <p> What, in Rizal's view, was a good woman? Here we may refer to his famous 1889 "Letter to the Young Women ofMalolos," written when he learned that twenty daughters of that town's principalia had petitioned the Spanish Governor General to reverse the priest-inspired decision not to open a school for them.  In it he praises their bravery, especially for standing up to the priests, but his reasons for commending their desire for education have to do not with their own potential, but with their future role as mothers: </p>
         <blockquote> Young womanhood, the nursery of fruitful flowers, ought to accumulate riches to bequeath to its descendants. What could the offspring be of a woman whose only virtue is to murmur prayers ... ? The mother who can teach nothing else but how to kneel and kiss the hand should not expect any other kind of children but stupid ones or oppressed slaves.  </blockquote>
        <blockquote> Let us be reasonable and open our eyes, especially you women, because you are the ones who open the minds of men. Consider that a good mother is different from the one created by the friars ... The country should not expect honor and prosperity so long as the education of the child is defective, so long as the women who raise the children are enslaved and ignorant. Nothing can be drunk in a turbid and bitter spring. </blockquote>
        <blockquote> Everybody knows the power and the prudence of the women in the Philippines. Hence they bind them, chain them, weaken their spirit, so sure are they that so long as the mother is a slave, all her children can be enslaved also.        </blockquote>
        <blockquote> Teach your children to guard and love their honor, to love their fellowmen, their native land, and to perform their duties. Tell them repeatedly to prefer death with honor to life with dishonor. They should imitate the women of Sparta …        </blockquote>
      <p>Of the seven points Rizal makes at the end of this open letter, onJy one applies specifically to women:    </p>
        <blockquote> If Filipino woman will not change, she should not be entrusted with the education of her children. She should only bear them. She should be deprived of her authority in the home; otherwise she may  betray her husband, children, country and all. </blockquote>
    <p>As the last sentence suggests, Rizal also thinks of women as potential wives and helpers (katulong) to their patriotic husbands: </p>
        <blockquote> Why does not a young woman ask of the man she is going to love for a noble and honorable name, a manly heart that can protect her weakness, a noble mind that will not permit him to be the father of slaves? Instill in his mind activity and industry, noble behavior, worthy sentiments, and do not surrender your young womanhood to a weak and timid heart. When she becomes a wife, she should help her husband in every difficulty, encourage him, share with him all perils, console him and drive away all his woes. </blockquote>
    <p> Yet it appears in both his writings and the contours of his own life that to Rizal, the role of wife was considerably less important than that of mother. Although he waxed sentimental about his female friends and lost loves, Rizal was a bit of a butterfly, flitting across the Philippines and Europe from one flirtation to another until he finally married (Josephine Bracken), literally on the eve of his execution.  In the "Letter" he speaks of a vague "longing" for a woman who would be "the partner of our heart, who shares our happiness and our misfortune," but he spent most of his adult life without any such soulmate, and in his novels, Ibarra managed to be heroic with only the minimum of aid from hapless Maria Clara. A good wife might, be useful and pleasant, but a good mother was an absolute necessity. </p>
   <p> What Rizal and his fellow Propagandists were promoting in the face of Spanish patriarchy, in fact, was not true gender equality, but a rival revolutionary masculinity. These were young men who, when in Spain, enjoyed swordplay and shooting, and after seeing a Wild West show in Paris, formed the "Indios Bravos" (Brave Indians/Filipinos), a sporting club. Many of them were inveterate womanizers and gamblers, but, strong in the old double standard, clung to the belief that a woman's true virtue lay in her chastity. Even photographs of the Propagandists tend to reflect their masculine stance.  It is not surprising that they constantly proclaimed the (male) necessity to protect the (female) motherland.</p>
    <p> Imperialists tended to justify their domination on the grounds that they were more manly, brave and rational than the (implicitly effeminate and irrational) natives. The nationalists fought back by contradiction: We'll show you who's manly! Rizal proved himself more than a match for most Spaniards in "rational" discourse, as his scholarly edition ofMorga's Sucesos de Las Islas Filipinas was clearly intended to demonstrate. Other Propagandists demonstrated their manliness in other ways; Juan Luna was involved in a celebrated scandal when he defended his honor by killing his allegedly unfaithful wife (and her mother).</p>
    <p>In such a context, the role of woman (the motherland) is not to stand up and defend herself, but to choose which masculinity will control and protect her. In his "letter," Rizal appeals to the young women of Malolos to choose brave young revolutionaries over arrogant and greedy friars. This may be understandable, it may even have been necessary, but it was certainly not feminist. Filipino women have had some difficulty in dealing with this nationalist machismo. Most simply ignore it. Others fault Rizal for leaving women in a subordinate position.  But no feminist scholar, to the best of my knowledge, has come right out and said that the Propagandists may, in some sense, have been promoting the "nation" at the expense of its members </p>
    <p> There may be some justice in the claim that Andres Bonifacio and other heroes of the Revolution were more egalitarian. Bonifacio's wife, Gregorio de Jesus, is said to have regarded him as her "companion in life," implying genuine equality. Emilio Jacinto, in the "Teachings of the Katipunan," exhorts, "Do not look at woman as a mere plaything but rather as a partner and one who shares in the difficulties of our life." Apolinario Mabini actually proposed female suffrage on the same basis as male (i.e. with educational and financial qualifications) in the Malolos Constitution of 1899, though his radical draft was defeated in favor of a more conservative version. 88 There is a certain logic to this, if we take Hispanization to be the core ofFilipino patriarchal values, since the ilustrados of the Propaganda movement were, by and large, more Hispanized than the leaders of the Katipunan. It may not be accurate to characterize the Revolution as "The Revolt of the Masses," but its leaders seem to have been somewhat more in touch with indigenous concepts of gender complementarity than their elite predecessors.  </p>
    <p> When it comes to the Revolution and the Filipino-American War, there has been a great deal of recent celebration of female participation, a useful corrective to the customary "Boys-Own" version of these events. Much of it simply takes the form of cataloging women revolutionaries. Some actually fought, and a few rose to be called "General," though only one was officially recognized as such. Many more served as spies and couriers, or provided supplies ( especially food) and medical services. Some of the most celebrated heroines of the Revolution, in fact, are chiefly known for their nursing activities, including Trinidad Tecson, "The Mother ofBiak-na-Bato," though she also fought when necessary.    </p>
    <p>Most of this research serves to validate (if validation is necessary) the patriotism ofFilipinas, but it tells us little about how gender roles were perceived and altered, except for the obvious fact that in the heat of revolution some women choose to take on the traditionally "male" role of warrior. Mina Roces, however, deliberately sets aside "the intrepid women who fought as men," and tries to focus instead on "gendered" roles, "the activities identified with the feminine": running the Red Cross, serving as hostess of(and keeping watch over) meetings of revolutionaries, etc.    </p>
    <p>Rather than ignoring the implications of the fact that almost all the officials of the women's chapter of the Katipunan and the Red Cross were the wives or sisters of nationalist leaders, with their rank in these organizations corresponding to their husbands' or brothers' standing outside,  Roces sees it as evidence of the empowerment of these women. Nepotism does not disqualify their power, but (in a sense) confirms it, since they are operating within a value system in which power is "held not just by the individual but by the kinship group." Ideally, the wife is not just her husband's "helper," but his partner, even his "alter ego." Eventually "women worked the levers of power without holding the institutional symbols of office, all the while preserving the male leadership in the public front.    </p>
    <p> Certainly, such perceptions were and are held by many Filipinos, yet it is hard to see where they vary significantly from those of traditional patriarchy, in which a woman's status is regularly inscribed in terms of the men to whom she belongs. It is interesting that when Gregoria de Jesus herself(according to Roces) wrote her memoirs, "she chose to describe her role using the male yardstick of what constitutes participating in the revolution, for she saw her most important role as the times she performed similar duties as the katipuneros." If women were, indeed, operating in terms of a different value system, they do not seem to have been particularly aware of it.    </p>
    <p> What Roces seems to be describing is less an alternative to patriarchy than a strategy for manipulating it, and here we have the heart of the paradox of women in the 19th century Philippines. Women's lives clearly changed, but their perception of them did not-or more precisely, if their perceptions did change, we have not managed to track down evidence of it. We do not, as yet, even know "what women learned when men gave them advice," in the form of their own contemporary reworking of patriarchal myths, values and structure.    </p>
    <p> One simple but powerful explanation for his apparent paradox, offered most explicitly by Cristina Blanc-Szanton, is that Filipinos never fully internalized the values of "Mediterranean" gender ideology in the first place. Instead, they adapted Hispanic culture selectively. Latin machismo fitted in nicely with indigenous patterns of male fighting, drinking and bragging or joking about sex, but women did not accept, and were not forced into, the binary evil-unless-totallypure stereotypes of Spanish Catholicism. Although chastity was encouraged in Visayan women, Blanc-Szanton observes, its absence did not entail total condemnation or ostracism, as it would have in the Mediterranean. "Among (the images) that did not take hold are (those) of Eve and the Virgin Mary as the Immaculate Conception."    </p>
    <p> Her argument is strong, but it leaves us hungry for specific historical evidence that would further illuminate the discrepancy between public gender ideology and daily reality for the Filipinas of the 19th century. There are still many contemporary sources to explore, including literary, theatrical and musical text sawit, corrido, kundiman, zarzuela, moro-moro, etc.-though so far as we know, most of these are also composed by men. To hear genuine Filipina voices, we may have to winkle their utterances out of obscure corners of the archives, where women appear as occasional petitioners, witnesses or the accused in criminal cases. We may also be able to hear them in early 20th century texts, when American education and greater press freedom opened the door for more women's writing, but we will have to use these texts with caution, since the very American presence that made them possible also introduced new gender ideologies (including American feminism, brought over with fervor by Carrie Chapman Catt in 1912). More recent ethnographic and sociological studies, though they may usefully suggest ongoing themes in Filipino practices and perception of gender, cannot by themselves document the mentalities of the Spanish period.    </p>
    <p> What we are left with, for now, is women who did not dispute the binary opposition of (bad) Eve and (good) Mary in religious texts, who sought out the self-abnegating advice of Urbana at Felisa, and who took Maria Clara as a model of Filipino womanhood, but who at the same time were responding to the challenges that colonialism and capitalism presented to Philippine society. The lives of many of them were transformed by the opportunities and problems they faced, but they did not openly articulate any response, so far as we know. Filipinas made the best of their situation, moved or stayed put as they had to, worked in new industries or in old rice-paddies, married younger (if at all), supported the state ( or the revolution) quietly, and kept going to church-when they felt like it. They may have admired Maria Clara as an ideal, but they demonstrated a great deal more resourcefulness than she ever did.    </p>
